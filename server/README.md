# Contact-Word-Game
It's a "Campfire" game that people enjoy.


# Inspiration
 - One day I was hanging out with my brother-in-law's family and one of his brothers suggested we play this beautiful game of Contact. A simple yet enjoyable game that I have enjoyed and passed on to many others to enjoy as well.


# Tech Stack
